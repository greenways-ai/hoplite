# Hoplite

[Hoplite](https://github.com/greenways-ai/hoplite) is a Hara application server
for Nginx. It embeds the [Hara](https://github.com/hara-lang/hara) runtime in
each worker and maps asynchronous Nginx operations onto Hara promises and
coroutine suspension.

## Quick start

Hoplite currently uses a sibling Hara checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hara-lang/hara.git hara.lang
git clone https://github.com/greenways-ai/hoplite.git hoplite
cd hoplite
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -- eval '(+ 19 23)'
cargo run
```

The last command opens the Hoplite REPL. From there, Nginx can be controlled
without leaving the session:

```text
/nginx start examples
/nginx status examples
/nginx reload examples
/nginx stop examples
```

The implementation supports two request paths:

The implementation supports two request paths:

1. A synchronous HAL function receives an HTTP request map and returns a response map.
2. `std.native.Host/call` yields a Hara promise, `std.foundation.coroutine/await` suspends the bytecode VM fiber, and an Nginx timer resolves that promise without blocking the worker.

## Architecture

```text
HTTP request
    -> ngx_http_hoplite_module
    -> HTA request value
    -> worker-local Hoplite WorkRuntime
    -> HAL handler
       -> response map, or
       -> Host/call("nginx", "sleep", [milliseconds])
            -> unresolved Hara Promise
            -> suspended VM fiber
            -> ngx_event_t timer
            -> hoplite_call_resolve/hoplite_call_reject(...)
            -> Promise resolution
            -> queued fiber resumption
    -> HTA response value
    -> Nginx response
```

There is one `HopliteRuntime` per Nginx worker. Runtime values, promises, fibers, and host calls never cross worker boundaries.

## Nginx configuration

```nginx
events {}

http {
    hoplite_bootstrap /etc/hoplite/app.hal;

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location /hello {
            hoplite_content hoplite.app/hello;
        }

        location /delay {
            hoplite_content hoplite.app/delayed;
        }
    }
}
```

`hoplite_bootstrap` is evaluated once during each worker's `init_process` lifecycle. It must complete synchronously. `hoplite_content` identifies a function loaded by that bootstrap source.

## HAL handlers

```clojure
(ns hoplite.app)

(defn hello [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"content-type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8"}
   :body "Hello from Hoplite\n"})

(defn ^:async delayed [request]
  (std.foundation.coroutine/await
    (std.native.Host/call "nginx" "sleep" [25]))
  {:status 200
   :headers {"content-type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8"}
   :body "resumed\n"})
```

The request value currently contains:

```clojure
{:method "GET"
 :uri "/inspect?a=1"
 :path "/inspect"
 :query-string "a=1"
 :remote-address "127.0.0.1"
 :headers {"Host" "localhost:8080"}}
```

A handler returns:

```clojure
{:status 200
 :headers {"content-type" "text/plain"}
 :body "hello"}
```

The response body may be a Hara string or byte value.

## Run the Docker experiment

From the directory containing sibling `hoplite` and `hara.lang` checkouts:

```bash
docker build -f hoplite/docker/Dockerfile -t hoplite .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hoplite
```

Then:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello
curl -i http://localhost:8080/delay
curl -i http://localhost:8080/inspect?sample=true
```

## Native build

On macOS, install the native dependencies first:

```bash
brew install openssl@3 pcre2
```

Build the worker runtime:

```bash
make runtime
```

Build the pinned Nginx distribution with Hoplite statically built in:

```bash
make nginx NGINX_SRC=/path/to/nginx-1.30.4
```

Build the standalone Hoplite executable:

```bash
make macos
```

`osx` is an alias for `macos`. The resulting
`target/dist/hoplite-v<version>-<target>` is the complete distribution: the
Hara runtime and statically linked Hoplite Nginx host are embedded in that one
executable. The Makefile downloads and verifies the pinned Nginx source, then
prints the executable checksum and installation instructions. Set
`NGINX_SRC=/path/to/nginx-1.30.4` only to override the downloaded source tree.

The build uses Homebrew OpenSSL and PCRE2 static archives while compiling, but
the resulting executable has no Homebrew runtime-library dependency. There is
no loadable Hoplite module, separate Nginx executable, or runtime shared
library to deploy.

## CLI

Hoplite packages the Hara evaluator with the Nginx host and application-server
commands:

```bash
cargo build --release
hoplite eval '(+ 19 23)'
hoplite run app.hal
hoplite serve
hoplite serve install /path/to/project
hoplite serve status /path/to/project
hoplite serve uninstall /path/to/project
```

Running `hoplite` without a command opens the Hoplite REPL. It evaluates Hara
forms and packages Nginx lifecycle controls directly into the session:

```text
/nginx start [PROJECT]
/nginx stop [PROJECT]
/nginx reload [PROJECT]
/nginx status [PROJECT]
/nginx build [PROJECT]
/nginx check [PROJECT]
```

`hoplite serve build` emits `.hoplite/app.hal`, the HBC2 bytecode artifact
`.hoplite/app.hbc`, and a generated Nginx configuration. `server.edn` controls
`:hoplite/listen` and `:hoplite/workers`; `routes.edn` maps route `:path` values
to Hara `:handler` vars. `hoplite serve foreground` keeps the embedded host in
the foreground for service managers. On macOS,
`hoplite serve install /path/to/project` creates and loads a per-user
LaunchAgent; `hoplite serve uninstall /path/to/project` unloads and removes it.
Set `HOPLITE_NGINX` only when deliberately overriding the embedded host for
development.

## Runtime ABI

The Rust library exposes a native-safe C ABI:

```c
hoplite_runtime_t *hoplite_runtime_new(void);
uint64_t hoplite_work_start(...);
size_t hoplite_work_poll(...);
int hoplite_work_next_event(...);
int hoplite_work_send(...);
int hoplite_call_resolve(...);
int hoplite_call_reject(...);
int hoplite_work_cancel(...);
int hoplite_work_close(...);
```

Unlike the existing 32-bit-oriented raw HTA pointer packing, `hoplite_work_next_event` returns pointer and length through an explicit `hoplite_buffer_t`, making the bridge safe for native 64-bit Nginx processes.

Events retain Hara's HTA envelope:

```text
[0 work result]                                      completion
[1 work error]                                       failure
[2 call work "HOPLITE" nil service method arguments] host request
```

## Current boundary

The current boundary supports:

- one Hara runtime per worker;
- bootstrap evaluation;
- request maps;
- response status, headers, strings, and bytes;
- coroutine suspension over a host promise;
- `nginx/sleep` through `ngx_event_t`;
- request cancellation and work cleanup;
- Nginx configuration reload through normal worker replacement.

Request-body reading, subrequests, upstreams, streaming, and WebSocket events
remain host-adapter work. They use the same `Host/call -> Promise -> suspended
fiber -> hoplite_call_resolve/hoplite_call_reject` path demonstrated by the
timer; none of them belongs inside `Promise`.
